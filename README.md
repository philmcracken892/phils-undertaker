Phil's Undertaker Extravaganza README ⚰️
Welcome to Phil's Undertaker, the creepiest, creep-tastic RedM roleplay experience this side of the frontier! Forget bounty hunting—this is the wild world of undertaking, where you haul "departed" NPCs in your trusty wagon and turn grim work into gold. Grab your shovel, polish your hearse (okay, it’s a wagon), and get ready to be the best darn undertaker in the West! 😈

What's This Spooky Business About? 🪦
In Phil's Undertaker, you’re not chasing outlaws or wrangling cattle—you’re collecting bodys (human NPCs, not the living kind) and delivering them to hunter camps for a tidy profit. Think of it as running a mobile mortuary, but with more dust, fewer tears, and a surprising amount of paperwork. 📜

Here’s what you’ll be doing:

Buy a Creepy Wagon: Snag a hunting wagon to haul your, ahem, clients. It’s the Rolls-Royce of corpse carts!
Collect "Bodys": Pick up those poor NPCs who’ve had a really bad day and store them in your wagon. No animals allowed—they’re too lively for this gig.
Cash In: Sell your wagon’s cargo at a hunter camp for some sweet, sweet gold. Don’t ask what happens to the bodies—it’s above your pay grade.
Fix Your Wagon: Because even undertakers hit potholes (or tombstones). Repair it when it breaks, or you’ll be carrying bodies on your back. 😵
Shop for Spooky Goods: Visit the undertaker shop for all your grim needs.
How to Be the Grim Reaper’s Favorite Employee 😎
Find a  Camp:
Check your map for blips that scream, “Undertaker Central!” They’re like neon signs for the recently deceased.
Stroll up and open the Menu. It’s less “happy hour” and more “final hour,” but you get the vibe.
Get Your Wagon:
Buy a  wagon if your pockets are deep, or spawn one you already own. Warning: These wagons don’t come with air fresheners.
If your wagon’s taken a beating (probably from that one time you tried to “shortcut” through a graveyard), pay to fix it. Tombstones are tougher than they look.
Collect Your Clients:
Find a human NPC who’s, uh, ready for transport. No live ones, no animals, and definitely no players (unless you want a ban and a bad reputation).
Carry them to your wagon and store them with a fancy progress bar. It’s like tucking them in for a very long nap.
Interact with your wagon to manage your creepy cargo. Don’t worry, they’re not going anywhere.
Make It Rain (Gold, Not Souls):
Head to a hunter camp and sell your wagon’s load for profit. The fuller the wagon, the bigger the payout. Cha-ching! 💸
Check your wagon’s inventory to admire your handiwork or pull a body out for... uh, quality control? Yeah, let’s go with that.
Store Your Wagon:
Park your wagon at a camp when you’re done. Or sell it if you’re ready to retire and open a flower shop instead. 🌸
Pro Tips for Top-Notch Undertakers 🖤
Humans Only, Please: Animals don’t belong in the wagon—they’re too wiggly, and the paperwork’s a nightmare. Stick to human NPCs.
Keep Your Wagon Intact: Crashing into a tree is bad for business. If it breaks, you’ll be stuck hauling bodies the old-fashioned way. Ouch.
Don’t Spam the Menu: Give the menu a second to load, or it’ll throw a tantrum and leave you staring at nothing but tumbleweeds.
Known Hiccups (Because Even Undertakers Have Bad Days) 😅
Wagon Disappears?: If your hearse-on-wheels vanishes, it might be damaged. Head to a camp to repair or respawn it. No, it didn’t get haunted... probably.
Body Won’t Store?: Make sure you’re carrying a human NPC. Animals and players are a hard no—unless you want an error message with attitude.
Menu Acting Shy?: If the menu doesn’t pop up, give it a moment. It’s probably just spooked by all the bodies you’re hauling.
Blip Blues: If camp blips don’t show, check your map settings or yell at the server admin (nicely, of course).
A Word From Phil, Your Creepy Boss 👻
“Welcome to the family business, partner! Keep those wagons rolling and the bodies piling. Don’t ask too many questions, don’t sniff the cargo, and always tip your hat to the dead. They’re your bread and butter, after all!” – Phil, probably.

Need Help? 🕸️
If you’re stuck, lost, or accidentally tried to store a horse in your wagon (we’ve all been there), holler at the server staff or check the script’s config for details. And no, we don’t offer refunds for “haunted wagon” claims. You signed up for this spooky life!

Now go make the frontier a little deader, you magnificent undertaker, you! ⚰️💀

Disclaimer: No actual NPCs were harmed in the making of this script. Well, maybe a little. Okay, they’re fine... mostly. 😜

Let me know if you want to tweak the tone, add specific server details, or include anything else (like server rules, Discord links, or undertaker-themed puns)! If you need help with the script itself or integrating this README into your server, just ask.
